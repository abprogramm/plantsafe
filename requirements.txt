ultralytics # This will pull in torch, torchvision, numpy, Pillow, pyyaml etc.
opencv-python-headless # For cv2 functions
gunicorn # For deployment

# Optional, but recommended for pinning versions:
# You can find compatible versions used by ultralytics after install
# and pin them here for more stable builds, e.g.:
# torch==2.x.x
# torchvision==0.x.x
# numpy==1.2x.x
# Pillow==10.x.x
